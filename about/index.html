<h1>About Me</h1>
</header>
<p>I am a Senior Software Engineer and Certified Cloud Solutions Architect with over ten years of experience writing, debugging, and managing software systems at scale. From single-page applications to backend microservices, and from large-scale data ingestion to cloud infrastructure, my experience puts me in the perfect positions to help you solve your problems.</p>
<p>As a native Texan, I was raised in a culture of hard work and accountability. After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, I went on to learn systems, front end, and backend software from many talented coworkers at Freescale, HP, and IBM. At VividCortex (now SWI), I have gained a wealth of experience in large-scale data ingestion, cloud hosted containerized microservice, and SQL database optimization and administration. Through a lifelong fascination with technology, I have gained a wide range of skills in adjacent fields including business process automation, content generation, and more.</p>
